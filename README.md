# SQL-Case-Study-Danny-s-Dinner.

## Overview

This project is part of a SQL case study where we analyze customer behavior for **Danny’s Diner**, a small restaurant serving sushi, curry, and ramen. The analysis helps Danny understand customer patterns and spending habits, supporting decisions for a potential loyalty program.

## Problem Statement

Danny wants to make data-driven decisions to expand his diner and loyalty program. Using basic data collected from **sales**, **menu**, and **members** tables, we answer key questions through SQL to uncover actionable insights.

## Datasets Used

* `menu` – Contains menu items and their prices
* `sales` – Transaction records with customer visits and menu items
* `members` – Information on loyalty program members and join dates

## Key Business Questions Answered

1. What is the total amount each customer spent?
2. How many days has each customer visited?
3. What was the first item purchased by each customer?
4. What is the most purchased item overall?
5. What is the most popular item for each customer?
6. Which item was first purchased after joining the membership?
7. What was bought just before joining the membership?
8. How much did each member spend before becoming a member?
9. How many loyalty points does each customer earn?
10. How many points do customers A and B earn by the end of January?
